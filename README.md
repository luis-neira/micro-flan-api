# Express 2025

**Express 2025** is a practice repository designed to explore and demonstrate various features of the Express.js framework in a Node.js environment. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with middleware, routing, error handling, and other Express-related functionalities.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or higher)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
* [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) (for database migrations and queries)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luis-neira/express-2025.git
   cd express-2025
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define necessary environment variables. For example:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run database migrations (if applicable):**

   ```bash
   npx knex migrate:latest
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🧪 Available Scripts
